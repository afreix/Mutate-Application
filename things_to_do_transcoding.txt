Things do to for the transcoding application

1. Figure out how to get file information from the application - probably getid3
2. Figure out how to display only the possible presets.
3. Transcode the file from the application and produce and outfile

Things to keep into account for the future
--------------------------------------------
1. getID3 doesnt work with temporary/corrupt files or .dv (maybe others as well)
2. If a corrupt files is somehow uploaded (there is very little checking on uploaded files) it will error bc of getID3
3. refreshing in the middle of a transcode is not good
